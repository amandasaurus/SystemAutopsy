SystemAutopsy is a programme to take a quick snapshot of what your Linux system
is doing and save that to a file

If a server has a problem, one often has to try to figure out what's going on
and also also get it back running. Sometimes one don't have the time to figure
out what's wrong, you have to get things works *now*. Sometimes there are easy
solutions you can do (like restart a server/service), but that means you can no
longer diagnose the problem.

SystemAutopsy is designed for these cases. It saves the output from various
commands/stats to files, allowing you to pour over it later.
